# chsh-wrapper

# 20210804
# 0.2.1

# Changes:
# 1. /chsh/chsh-wrapper/
# 2. - system_chsh()
# 3. /extended_list_of_shell/extended_list_of_shell_paths/
# 4. ~ chsh(), so that it now takes a shell path, since not all shells are located in /bin.
# 5. + shell_path_for(), so that I can translate the shell name to a path for chsh when the shell is specified in ARGV[0], which now requires that.
# 1: 
# 6. ~ main(), to make use of required_shell consistently rather than ARGV[0].
# 7. ~ shell_path_for(): /each_with_index/each/
